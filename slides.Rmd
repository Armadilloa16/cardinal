## Colophon

These slides were written in [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) inside 
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). 
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word 
documents.
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) converted the 
raw Rmarkdown to html. The complete source is available from 
[github](https://github.com/Armadilloa16/cardinal). The wording for this 
colophon was inspired by [hadley's book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), which is a 
useful resource I would reccomend to anyone aspiring to learn to write packages
for R.
